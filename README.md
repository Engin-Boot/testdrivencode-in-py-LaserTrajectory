# Compute Statistics

Here we compute statistics for a bunch of numbers.

This project uses the
[unittest framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
to test functionality.

## Pass the tests

The code is not complete and doesn't work.
See the results of execution in the GitHub 'Actions' tab.

Recognize the intention of the code by reading the tests.
Design the return type in the code.
You may alter the test while keeping its intent.
